# Escaping Misthalin

## Intro & Relic choices

The number one priority throughout the league is going to be to complete tasks. While this guide contains a fairly thorough step-by-step guide, it's extremely important to adapt on the fly and get tasks done. The sooner you unlock new relics and new regions, the better. Always, always, always focus on completing tasks.

### Tier 1 Relics

* [ ] Endless Harvest - Double fishing/woodcutting/mining resources & auto bank
* [ ] Production Master - Process all items in 1 batch
* [x] Skilling Prodigy - +12 boost to non-combat skills (including slayer)

Skilling Prodigy is going to be by far the best relic, especially if you aren't planning on maxing. Be very careful if you select Production Master since you can accidentally smelt your ores for Doric's quest or accidentally cook your sardine for Gertrude's Cat. Endless Harvest just sucks in general and will be annoying while doing quests since you'll have to go to the bank to grab things like sardines & logs & ores. Remember to use Skilling Prodigy to its fullest. If you forget that you can, for example, cut oak logs at level 3 woodcutting, then the relic becomes a lot less powerful. It may help to have a cheat sheet handy during the early game.

### Tier 2 Relics

* [ ] Relic 1: Crossed swords with directional arrows - Unknown, maybe unlocks additional teleports, perhaps to slayer tasks
* [ ] Relic 2: Necklace & hands - Speculated to be unlimited jewelry teleports
* [x] Relic 3: Refresh icon - Speculated to be unlimited home/minigame/area teleports

This one is going to depend a lot on what Relic 1 is, so be ready to pivot if necessary. Assuming that it isn't worth unlocking, Relic 3 seems to be the best, since it gives unlimited teleports to mortton (barrows) and castle wars and some important early game teleports into Kandarin (fishing trawler, nightmare zone). It really isn't worth unlocking unlimited jewelry since it has a lot of overlap with minigame teleports & jewelry is so easy to get anyway.

### Tier 3 Relics

Appears to be split into melee, range, and magic. Take the melee one.

## Goals

Misthalin has a number of important early game unlocks:

* Tree spirits (no mage defense & safespottable = good xp, rune axe)
* Birdhouses (hunter xp, bird nests)
* Daddy's Home miniquest (construction xp, free house, expensive construction supplies)
* Lumbridge easy (free low alchs)

### Tree spirits

These guys have level 1 magic, so you will always hit regardless of your stats and gear. Their combat level is based on your level, so do not get unnecessary mage xp beforehand. If a tree spirit is 14 combat (the minimum) it will take 6.25 casts per kill. If it is 29 combat, it will take 10 casts per kill. Rune axes are 1/32, so you should expect 1 per 200-320 casts. Rune axes are garbage compared to how expensive they are. If you decide to keep an axe for personal use, stick with adamant. You also want to keep a mithril axe if you get one for animal magnetism.

Since magic levels are so important (for alchs, enchants, teleports, etc.) and early game gp are so important, this is a great place to spend your 10k.

You will also get some nature runes, which will be really nice once you have 55 magic.

### Daddy's Home

Although this miniquest requires some expensive materials, it gives a ton of construction xp, saves 1000 gp for buying a house, and gives some really important construction resources. Since it takes place in Varrock & the sawmill area, it offers some good multiquesting opportunities. Zulu has a video discussing this and steps will be recorded here at a later time. Essentially, you get items for cooks assistant + 1 bucket of milk, buy fishing supplies from Shilo village (pickpocket men/farmers for gp), fish sardines, cook all but 1, do stronghold of security, then do Gertrude's Cat and Daddy's Home at the same time, before finishing off Cook's Assistant in Lumbridge. He also gathers materials for Doric's Quest and Knight's Sword.

### Birdhouses

Since monkey madness 2 is completed when Kandarin is unlocked, we will likely end up wanting to chin to 99 range--ideally relatively early on in the league. There are also likely some hunter-related tasks in every region. With hunter being notoriously slow to train at low levels, it will be nice to do birdhouses until 63 hunter.

#### Requirements & Prerequisites

* Varrock museum - Not necessary, but just get 9 hunter & slayer beforehand (21 w/ Skilling Prodigy)
* 25 construction (13 w/ SP) - You will need to build a crafting table 2 in your POH (requires 1 molten glass). The reward from Daddy's Home will cover the steel bars and oak planks, as well as the materials required to get 13 construction. You just need to make molten glass
* Chronicle or law runes - For getting to fossil island via Varrock. Law runes will be hard to obtain in Misthalin, but can be obtained from dark wizards if you're desparate. Chronicle charges are expensive early game but probably worth it
