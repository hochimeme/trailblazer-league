# Escaping Misthalin

## Intro & Relic choices

The number one priority throughout the league is going to be to complete tasks. While this guide contains a fairly thorough step-by-step guide, it's extremely important to adapt on the fly and get tasks done. The sooner you unlock new relics and new regions, the better. Always, always, always focus on completing tasks.

### Tier 1 Relics

* [ ] Endless Harvest - Double fishing/woodcutting/mining resources & auto bank
* [ ] Production Master - Process all items in 1 batch
* [x] Skilling Prodigy - +12 boost to non-combat skills (including slayer)

Skilling Prodigy is going to be by far the best relic, especially if you aren't planning on maxing. Be very careful if you select Production Master since you can accidentally smelt your ores for Doric's quest or accidentally cook your sardine for Gertrude's Cat. Endless Harvest just sucks in general and will be annoying while doing quests since you'll have to go to the bank to grab things like sardines & logs & ores. Remember to use Skilling Prodigy to its fullest. If you forget that you can, for example, cut oak logs at level 3 woodcutting, then the relic becomes a lot less powerful. It may help to have a cheat sheet handy during the early game.

### Tier 2 Relics

* [ ] Relic 1: Crossed swords with directional arrows - Unknown, maybe unlocks additional teleports, perhaps to slayer tasks
* [ ] Relic 2: Necklace & hands - Speculated to be unlimited jewelry teleports
* [x] Relic 3: Refresh icon - Speculated to be unlimited home/minigame/area teleports

This one is going to depend a lot on what Relic 1 is, so be ready to pivot if necessary. Assuming that it isn't worth unlocking, Relic 3 seems to be the best, since it gives unlimited teleports to mortton (barrows) and castle wars and some important early game teleports into Kandarin (fishing trawler, nightmare zone). It really isn't worth unlocking unlimited jewelry since it has a lot of overlap with minigame teleports & jewelry is so easy to get since we have access to the gem mine right away & a +12 crafting boost.

### Tier 3 Relics

Appears to be split into melee, range, and magic. Take the melee one.

## Goals

The main goals of this guide is to 1. a source of gp 2. unlock bird houses and 3. complete important quests and diary steps. This is based loosely on a video by Zulu, but puts more emphasis on completing diary steps.

### Tree spirits

These guys have level 1 magic, so you will always hit regardless of your stats and gear. Their combat level is based on your level, so do not get unnecessary mage xp beforehand. If a tree spirit is 14 combat (the minimum) it will take 6.25 casts per kill. If it is 29 combat, it will take 10 casts per kill. Rune axes are 1/32, so you should expect 1 per 200-320 casts. Rune axes are garbage compared to how expensive they are. If you decide to keep an axe for personal use, stick with adamant. You also want to keep a mithril axe if you get one for animal magnetism.

Since magic levels are so important (for alchs, enchants, teleports, etc.) and early game gp is so important, this is a great place to spend your 10k.

You will also get some nature runes, which will be really nice once you have 55 magic.

### Daddy's Home

Although this miniquest requires some expensive materials, it gives a ton of construction xp, saves 1000 gp for buying a house, and gives some really important construction resources. Since it takes place in Varrock & the sawmill area, it offers some good multiquesting opportunities.

### Birdhouses

71 hunter is an important milestone in this league since it unlocks dragon implings in puro-puro, which is the easiest way of getting an amulet of glory. Since MM2 is auto-completed, chinning to 99 range early on in the tournament is going to be huge, not only for the increased DPS, but also for the prayer pot and oak plank drops.

### Lumbridge Easy Diary

If you made it this far, you are now set up to do bird house runs. The only things left are to:

* Buy a workshop (10k gp)
* Build the crafting table 2 and make clockworks using Daddy's Home rewards
* Obtain oak and willow logs
* Obtain hops seeds

You can get 10k by using your fire strike casts at nature spirits and selling rune axes to the jungle shop.

However, while birdhouses are good content to unlock early, it is not necessary to start doing them right away. This is a good opportunity to pivot and try to complete more tasks and finish off easy diaries, train skills, etc. Just remember to use your fire strike casts at tree spirits before you do any combat training.

## Other notes

* Big frogs and giant frogs are a good place to train relatively early on since they drop cosmic & nature runes and a shot at a water/earth talisman. Giant frogs drop big bones, big frogs drop regular bones & a chance at a water/earth talisman
* If we're able to unlock Kandarin before finishing this step-by-step guide, skip construction training and finish off your casts at tree spirits (don't sell axes yet), then start doing Kandarin content. You'll still want to rush bird houses, but doing tasks and quests in Kandarin takes priority. 

## Todo

* [ ] Patch in The Knight's Sword and Doric's Quest so that we can complete them immediately after unlocking Asgarnia
* [ ] Patch in steps to get a head start on Kandarin content (getting jute seeds, rusty sword for diaries)
