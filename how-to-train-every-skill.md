If a skill isn't listed, use the method from the previous region. If it is not listed in the first region, it's not worth training until more regions are unlocked

Skilling prodigy is assumed

# Misthalin

Melee: Use event rpg until addy sword. Do monks -> flesh crawlers -> giant spiders
Ranged: Avoid training in Misthalin, but use bronze arrows if you must
Prayer: Kill giant frogs or hill giants, but avoid training in Misthalin if at all possible
Magic: Kill nature spirits until they are above 13 combat. From there just fire strike anything with 1 magic. Not worth splashing since -64 mage bonus is too hard to get. Ideally avoid training magic here since you shouldn't need a high level & gp is hard to come by
Construction: Oak planks all the way. Bank in tzhaar, run to Brimhaven. Try to save house tabs
Agility: Draynor -> Varrock courses, should be easy points
Thieving: Farmers -> guards. Suicide instead of using food
Crafting: Buy molten glass materials and bank in tzhaar. Turn into molten glass in tzhaar or shilo depending on cash stack. Try not to do too much crafting in this region
Fletching: Train only if necessary for points. Just make the best bow you can up to willow
Hunter: Birdhouses
Mining: Powermine iron. Steel pickaxe can be obtained from ham members
Fishing: Fish salmon and trout in Shilo. Bank them
Cooking: Cook salmon and trout
Firemaking: Oak then willow logs
Woodcutting: Cut oaks to turn into planks later or willows for fm/fletching
Farming: Plant acorns if you get them but otherwise don't bother

# Kandarin

Melee: Through slayer
Ranged: Chin at mm2 caves, but put this off until late game when you have better gear if you can
Prayer: Kill hill giants by the observatory
Magic: Same as Misthalin, but kill Salarin if you're just gonna use fire strike anyway. You can also buy law runes from ape atoll now, so camelot teleports are in play (but expensive)
Runecrafting: Continue avoiding this skill, but the ZMI altar is there if you must train it
Construction: Continue with oak planks if you can afford them, but picking up planks at BA isn't the worst method in the world if you're poor. You can also buy a butler
Agility: You can start using the camelot course at 48 agility
Herblore: Chaos druids
Thieving: Ardy knights at 43
Crafting: Buy glass supplies in Catherby or port khazard. It is worth grinding gp to use the shilo furnace at this point in the game
Slayer: Use Nieve, get a whip at 73
Hunter: Can start supplementing bird houses with chinchompas
Smithing: It might be feasible to start banking iron in this region, so smelt those. Superheat is also viable
Fishing: Unlock barb fishing unless you need food
Cooking: Either continue cooking fish that you've banked or buy raw karambwans and cook them
Farming: Ideally leave this for later in the game, but patches are available if you must train it. Master farmers are a good source of seeds

# Asgarnia

Melee: If you have unnatural selection, use Turael to get monkey tasks. Otherwise stick with Nieve
Ranged: You can now get a bone crossbow so use that if you haven't unlocked a MSB yet. You can also get void
Prayer: Blue dragons in taverly, but try to save them for the ectofuntus
Construction: Mahogany Homes might be viable now, but steel bars are probably still too hard to get
Mining: You can upgrade to a rune pickaxe now & use the mining guild if possible. MLM is an option but it isn't afk until the top level, even then...
Hunter/Fishing: With the Mogre miniquest, drift net fishing should now be viable

# Morytania

Melee: Bloodvelds or Gargoyles
Prayer: Ectofuntus
Agility: Sepulchre
Slayer: Slayer tower & black mask are now available
