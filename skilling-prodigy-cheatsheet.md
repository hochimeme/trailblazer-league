# Skilling Prodigy Cheatsheet
## Slayer

**Monster/Quest**|**Requirement**|**SP Req**|**Valuable Drops**|**Notes**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Bloodveld|50|38|Blood runes|Likely the best xp/hour until gargoyles are unlocked. Drops blood runes, but not enough to rely on.  Around 100 per task or so, which sells for 24k at the wizards guild.
Cave horror|58|46|Black mask|Camp these until you get a black mask. They’re garbage otherwise
Gargoyle|75|63|Raw gp|Drops a lot of alchables and raw gp. Some other drops that will be worth picking up, but nothing worth camping for. Since dark beasts are in Tirannwn, these will likely end up being a common place to get 99 melees. Bloodvelds will probably be better xp, but worse drops. Consider using Turael to get monkey tasks
Spiritual Mage|83|71|Dragon boots|Zamorak robes & monk robes for god items
Abyssal whip|85|73|Abyssal whip|With unnatural selection and skilling prodigy, these is a good chance that these are unlocked before Morytania. Kill them in the abyssal realm, otherwise use the slayer tower.
Cerberus|91|79|Primordial crystal|Prims honestly suck for how hard they are to get. Do not touch cerb until you have the 3x drop rate perk
Cave kraken|87|87|Trident/Tent|Cannot be boosted. Trident sucks at tob if you aren’t a mage role
Smoke devil|93|93|Occult necklace|Cannot be boosted, don’t bother unless planning on maging. Even then it isn’t that good

### Notes

* Rum Deal is auto completed when Morytania is unlocked, so no questing is required to access Cave Horrors
* The 18 slayer requirement for Animal Magnetism is not boostable, but the Varrock Museum quiz should get you there

## Construction

**Item**|**Requirement**|**SP Requirement**|**Notes**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Tool store 1|15|3|Saws, hammers, chisels, and shears. Not super useful but will be nice to have since banking will be a pain.
Oak dining table|22|10|Best way of training using oak planks for a while
Crafting table 2|25|13|You can make clockwork
Oak larder|33|21|Training
Tool store 4|44|32|Not worth unlocking if you have kandarin
Amulet of glory|47|35|It’s hard to get charged glories, but you probably won’t use it often
Portal chamber|50|38|You still need to be able to cast the spell
Demon butler|50|38|Not sure if this is boostable or not
Limestone altar|64|52|Best altar available, probably better xp/hour than ecto
Oubliette Flame pit|77|65|Costs 125k, but at least it’s obtainable. Used for suiciding in poh to reset stats
Scrying pool|80|68|Probably some smuggle bug involving this
Digsite pendant|82|70|Birdhouses
Fairy ring|85|73|Mushrooms can be obtained without morytania by cutting mushroom trees on fossil island

### Notes

* Construction starts at 13 due to Daddy's Home
* Building new rooms is indeed boostable
* Ornate pool is not available & other pools are worthless. Flame pit is the best alternative
