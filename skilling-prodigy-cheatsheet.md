# Skilling Prodigy Cheatsheet
## Slayer

**Monster/Quest**|**Requirement**|**SP Req**|**Valuable Drops**|**Notes**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Bloodveld|50|38|Blood runes|Likely the best xp/hour until gargoyles are unlocked. Drops blood runes, but not enough to rely on.  Around 100 per task or so, which sells for 24k at the wizards guild.
Cave horror|58|46|Black mask|Camp these until you get a black mask. They’re garbage otherwise
Gargoyle|75|63|Raw gp|Drops a lot of alchables and raw gp. Some other drops that will be worth picking up, but nothing worth camping for. Since dark beasts are in Tirannwn, these will likely end up being a common place to get 99 melees. Bloodvelds will probably be better xp, but worse drops. Consider using Turael to get monkey tasks
Spiritual Mage|83|71|Dragon boots|Zamorak robes & monk robes for god items
Abyssal whip|85|73|Abyssal whip|With unnatural selection and skilling prodigy, these is a good chance that these are unlocked before Morytania. Kill them in the abyssal realm, otherwise use the slayer tower.
Cerberus|91|79|Primordial crystal|Prims honestly suck for how hard they are to get. Do not touch cerb until you have the 3x drop rate perk
Cave kraken|87|87|Trident/Tent|Cannot be boosted. Trident sucks at tob if you aren’t a mage role
Smoke devil|93|93|Occult necklace|Cannot be boosted, don’t bother unless planning on maging. Even then it isn’t that good

### Other Notes

* Rum Deal is auto completed when Morytania is unlocked, so no questing is required to access Cave Horrors
* The 18 slayer requirement for Animal Magnetism is not boostable, but the Varrock Museum quiz should get you there
