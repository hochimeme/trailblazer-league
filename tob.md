Like with Twisted League, the meta is likely going to be to complete as many tasks as possible to unlock the top relics. Tier 3 seems like an especially important unlock for ToB purposes, since it makes drop-dependent activities (barrows, kraken, GWD, etc.) more viable *and* unlocks a combat relic. Unlocking tier 3 should be the top priority--worry about stats, gear, quests etc. second.

## ToB strategy
* Karils crossbow is realistically going to be the best range weapon available
  * Pay attention to the tier 3 combat relics though. They may make the MSB viable, potentially saving a lot of time at barrows
* In a trio, we probably want 1 mager on ancients, and 2 dpsers
  * Mager freezes s1234 at maiden
* Trident is nice to have, but not required. Iban's blast is fine if you are on standards, blood blitz will be fine for nylo boss if you are on ancients

## Region unlocks (in order)

* Magers: Kandarin, Morytania, Desert
* Meleers: Kandarin, Asgarnia, Morytania

## ToB Gear

Weapons:
* Karils crossbow for range--All roles should have this. Will be important to have the DPS for xarpus
* Whip--Get a kraken tentacle if possible
* Trident--Can be subbed out for an ibans staff if you aren't freezing. But a relatively easy item to get, so just get it
* Rune/adamant crossbow--might be worth bringing for web phase
* Bandos godsword--Hopefully someone can get one from GWD. Get as many of these on your team as possible

Armor:
* Karils/Black dhide--Use full karils if you have it (w/ amulet of the damned), otherwise use black dhide
* Ahrims/mystics--Mystic can be bought at the mage guild, but hopefully the mager gets some ahrims pieces from barrows. You don't need mage gear if you are not freezing, but it may be nice to have for nylo boss
* Fighter torso--probably don't 100% need this, but it'll be nice to have the strength bonus
* Obsidian legs--Costs 87k tokkul, might be better to just camp dhide chaps but I'm not sure
* Obsidian helmet--73k tokkul, prioritize over legs

Other gear:
* Fury--You might get enough tokkul from barrows for a fury, in which case it's worth it to get the crafting level. Otherwise, idk get a glory I guess
* Fire cape
* Accumulator
* Dragon boots--dps role only
* Dragon defender--dps role only
* RFD gloves--idk what the best gloves available are, but get them
* Salve amulet
* Ruby bolts--if you bring a rcb for webs

## Early game notes
* Prioritize tasks over levels over gear
* Unlock bone crossbow early
* Strength amulet can be obtained from ham chests, get a cosmic rune from big frogs in the lumbridge swamp (6/128 for 2)
* Dragon scim will be a good mainhand until you can get a whip
* Do as many hard clues as you can, black dhide, rune armor, and magic shortbows will all be nice to have
* Rune sword > rune scim
* Climbing boots are a nice early unlock for dps roles
* Buy a chronicle ASAP
* Don't bother with slayer until 85 combat
